THE KEYBOARD LOCKER

1. How to use

This simple program will disable the keyboard when you
press Ctrl+Alt+L.

Once the keyboard is locked, you can type in "unlock" to
unlock it.

You can enable balloon notifications when the keyboard is
locked or unlocked by right clicking on the tray icon
(looks like a keyboard) and clicking on "Show tray
notifications."
